1. Install all the dependicies in package.json using npm install.
2. You can test the backend nodejs api using postman for all the crud operations. All are wroking fine.
3. Front end is also working fine but not designed properly and also no validations due to limited time.
4. I have not added the image upload function because we read the file in front end and then upload to AWS and save the link to databse. But this is not possible to do in this project as we need AWS S3 account for that.
5. Thank you.
